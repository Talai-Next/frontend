# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



## Getting Started  

### Installation  

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, run the following command:  

```sh
npm install
```
or using Yarn:  
```sh
yarn install
```
or using PNPM:  
```sh
pnpm install
```

### Running the Development Server  

Start the development server with:  

```sh
npm run dev

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173/` (default port).
